# General Overview

## High level overview
Our internet comes in from the street over at the Hackler Gymnasium. There is a Comcast router there, which we try not to touch because it is old. From there a cable runs from the Gym to the Low Building, and it comes into our backroom.

It goes directly into our firewall, which then runs into a Layer 3 Cisco switch. From there it is divided into 4 networks explained below:

- Lab - Mess around here
- Class - Don't mess around here, poeple need internet
- Server - All servers go here, don't touch plz
- Security - Level 3 cybersecurity stuff
